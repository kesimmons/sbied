## Build the `pomp` object

### Preliminaries

```{r mpi-setup,include=FALSE,purl=TRUE,cache=FALSE}
library(foreach)
library(doMPI)

cl <- startMPIcluster()
registerDoMPI(cl)
```

Load the packages we'll need, and set the random seed, to allow reproducibility.
```{r prelims,cache=FALSE}
set.seed(594709947L)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
library(plyr)
library(reshape2)
library(magrittr)
library(pomp)
stopifnot(packageVersion("pomp")>="0.75-1")
```

### Data and covariates

Now we'll load the data and covariates.
The data are measles reports from 20 cities in England and Wales.
We also have information on the population sizes and birth-rates in these cities;
we'll treat these variables as covariates.

```{r load-data}
daturl <- "http://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/twentycities.rda"
datfile <- file.path(tempdir(),"twentycities.rda")
download.file(daturl,destfile=datfile,mode="wb")
load(datfile)
measles %>% 
  mutate(year=as.integer(format(date,"%Y"))) %>%
  subset(town=="London" & year>=1950 & year<1964) %>%
  mutate(time=(julian(date,origin=as.Date("1950-01-01")))/365.25+1950) %>%
  subset(time>1950 & time<1964, select=c(time,cases)) -> dat
demog %>% subset(town=="London",select=-town) -> demog
```


```{r prep-covariates}
demog %>% 
  summarize(
    time=seq(from=min(year),to=max(year),by=1/12),
    pop=predict(smooth.spline(x=year,y=pop),x=time)$y,
    birthrate=predict(smooth.spline(x=year+0.5,y=births),x=time-4)$y
    ) -> covar
```

### The (unobserved) process model

The following implements a simulator.

```{r rprocess}
rproc <- Csnippet("
  double beta, br, seas, foi, dw, births;
  double rate[6], trans[6];
  
  // cohort effect
  if (fabs(t-floor(t)-251.0/365.0) < 0.5*dt) 
    br = cohort*birthrate/dt + (1-cohort)*birthrate;
  else 
  	br = (1.0-cohort)*birthrate;

  // term-time seasonality
  t = (t-floor(t))*365.25;
  if ((t>=7&&t<=100) || (t>=115&&t<=199) || (t>=252&&t<=300) || (t>=308&&t<=356))
      seas = 1.0+amplitude*0.2411/0.7589;
    else
      seas = 1.0-amplitude;

  // transmission rate
  beta = R0*(gamma+mu)*seas;
  // expected force of infection
  foi = beta*pow(I+iota,alpha)/pop;
  // white noise (extrademographic stochasticity)
  dw = rgammawn(sigmaSE,dt);

  rate[0] = foi*dw/dt;  // stochastic force of infection
  rate[1] = mu;			    // natural S death
  rate[2] = sigma;		  // rate of ending of latent stage
  rate[3] = mu;			    // natural E death
  rate[4] = gamma;		  // recovery
  rate[5] = mu;			    // natural I death

  // Poisson births
  births = rpois(br*dt);
  
  // transitions between classes
  reulermultinom(2,S,&rate[0],dt,&trans[0]);
  reulermultinom(2,E,&rate[2],dt,&trans[2]);
  reulermultinom(2,I,&rate[4],dt,&trans[4]);

  S += births   - trans[0] - trans[1];
  E += trans[0] - trans[2] - trans[3];
  I += trans[2] - trans[4] - trans[5];
  R = pop - S - E - I;
  W += (dw - dt)/sigmaSE;  // standardized i.i.d. white noise
  C += trans[4];           // true incidence
")
```

We complete the process model definition by specifying the distribution of initial unobserved states.
The following codes assume that the fraction of the population in each of the four compartments is known.

```{r initializer}
initlz <- Csnippet("
  double m = pop/(S_0+E_0+I_0+R_0);
  S = nearbyint(m*S_0);
  E = nearbyint(m*E_0);
  I = nearbyint(m*I_0);
  R = nearbyint(m*R_0);
  W = 0;
  C = 0;
")
```

### The measurement model

We'll model both under-reporting and measurement error.
We want $\mathbb{E}[\text{cases}|C] = \rho\,C$, where $C$ is the true incidence and $0<\rho<1$ is the reporting efficiency.
We'll also assume that $\mathrm{Var}[\text{cases}|C] = \rho\,(1-\rho)\,C + (\psi\,\rho\,C)^2$, where $\psi$ quantifies overdispersion.
Note that when $\psi=0$, the variance-mean relation is that of the binomial distribution.
To be specific, we'll choose
$\text{cases|C} \sim f(\cdot|\rho,\psi,C)$,
where $$f(c|\rho,\psi,C) = \Phi(c+\tfrac{1}{2},\rho\,C,\rho\,(1-\rho)\,C+(\psi\,\rho\,C)^2)-\Phi(c-\tfrac{1}{2},\rho\,C,\rho\,(1-\rho)\,C+(\psi\,\rho\,C)^2),$$
where $\Phi(x,\mu,\sigma^2)$ is the c.d.f. of the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

The following computes $\mathbb{P}[\text{cases}|C]$.

```{r dmeasure}
dmeas <- Csnippet("
  double m = rho*C;
  double v = m*(1.0-rho+psi*psi*m);
  double tol = 1.0e-18;
  if (cases > 0.0) {
	  lik = pnorm(cases+0.5,m,sqrt(v)+tol,1,0)-pnorm(cases-0.5,m,sqrt(v)+tol,1,0)+tol;
  } else {
    lik = pnorm(cases+0.5,m,sqrt(v)+tol,1,0)+tol;
  }
")
```

The following codes simulate $\text{cases} | C$.

```{r rmeasure}
rmeas <- Csnippet("
  double m = rho*C;
  double v = m*(1.0-rho+psi*psi*m);
  double tol = 1.0e-18;
  cases = rnorm(m,sqrt(v)+tol);
  if (cases > 0.0) {
    cases = nearbyint(cases);
  } else {
    cases = 0.0;
  }
")
```
### Parameter transformations

The parameters are constrained to be positive, and some of them are constrained to lie between $0$ and $1$.
We can turn the likelihood maximization problem into an unconstrained maximization problem by transforming the parameters.
The following Csnippets implement such a transformation and its inverse.

```{r transforms}
toEst <- Csnippet("
  Tsigma = log(sigma);
  Tgamma = log(gamma);
  Tcohort = logit(cohort);
  Tamplitude = logit(amplitude);
  TsigmaSE = log(sigmaSE);
  Tpsi = log(psi);
  TR0 = log(R0);
  to_log_barycentric (&TS_0, &S_0, 4);
")

fromEst <- Csnippet("
 Tsigma = exp(sigma);
  Tgamma = exp(gamma);
  Tcohort = expit(cohort);
  Tamplitude = expit(amplitude);
  TsigmaSE = exp(sigmaSE);
  Tpsi = exp(psi);
  TR0 = exp(R0);
  from_log_barycentric (&TS_0, &S_0, 4);
")
```

### ML point estimates

## Profile over $\sigma_{SE}$

### Initial set of mifs

To compute a likelihood profile over a given parameter (or set of parameters) across some range, we first construct a grid of points spanning that range.
At each point in the grid, we fix the focal parameter (or set of parameters) at that value and maximize the likelihood over the remaining parameters.
To ensure that this optimization is global, we initiate multiple optimizers at a variety of points across the space.
The **pomp** function `profileDesign` is useful in constructing such a set of starting points for the optimization.

The following code constructs a data frame, each row of which is a starting point for an optimization.
We will be profiling over $\sigma_SE$ (`sigmaSE` in the code), fixing $\mu=0.02$ and $\alpha=1$.
To simplify the calculation still further, we will hold $\rho$ and $\iota$ at their ML point estimates.

```{r sigmaSE-prof-design}
estpars <- setdiff(names(theta),c("sigmaSE","mu","alpha","rho","iota"))

theta["alpha"] <- 1

theta.t <- partrans(m1,theta,"toEstimationScale")

theta.t.hi <- theta.t.lo <- theta.t
theta.t.lo[estpars] <- theta.t[estpars]-log(2)
theta.t.hi[estpars] <- theta.t[estpars]+log(2)

profileDesign(
  sigmaSE=seq(from=log(0.02),to=log(0.2),length=20),
  lower=theta.t.lo,upper=theta.t.hi,nprof=40
) -> pd

dim(pd)

pd <- as.data.frame(t(partrans(m1,t(pd),"fromEstimationScale")))

pairs(~sigmaSE+R0+mu+sigma+gamma+S_0+E_0,data=pd)
```

**pomp** provides two functions, `bake` and `stew`, that save the results of expensive computations.
We'll run the profile computations on a cluster using MPI.
Note that again, care must be taken with the parallel random number generator.

```{r sigmaSE-prof-round1,eval=TRUE,cache=FALSE}
bake("sigmaSE-profile1.rds",{
 
  foreach (p=iter(pd,"row"),
           .combine=rbind,

  ) %dopar% {

                        "rho","sigmaSE","psi","cohort","amplitude",
                        "S_0","E_0","I_0","R_0")
      ) %>% 
      mif2(start = unlist(p),
           Nmif = 50, 
           rw.sd = rw.sd(
             R0=0.02,sigma=0.02,gamma=0.02,psi=0.02,cohort=0.02,amplitude=0.02,

           Np = 1000,
           cooling.type = "geometric",
           cooling.fraction.50 = 0.1,
           transform = TRUE) %>%
      mif2() -> mf
    
    ## Runs 10 particle filters to assess Monte Carlo error in likelihood
    pf <- replicate(10, pfilter(mf, Np = 2000))
    ll <- sapply(pf,logLik)
    ll <- logmeanexp(ll, se = TRUE)
    nfail <- sapply(pf,getElement,"nfail")
    
    toc <- Sys.time()
    etime <- toc-tic
    units(etime) <- "hours"

    data.frame(as.list(coef(mf)),
               loglik = ll[1],
               loglik.se = ll[2],
               nfail.min = min(nfail),
               nfail.max = max(nfail),
               etime = as.numeric(etime))
  }
}) -> sigmaSE_prof
```

The preceding calculations took `r round(sum(sigmaSE_prof$etime),1)`&nbsp;cpu&nbsp;hr, or about `r signif(mean(sigmaSE_prof$etime)*3600/120,2)`&nbsp;cpu&nbsp;sec per iteration per 1000 particles.
Let's examine the results.

```{r round1-plot}
pairs(~loglik+sigmaSE+R0+I(1/gamma)+I(1/sigma)+psi+log(cohort),
      data=sigmaSE_prof,subset=loglik>max(loglik)-100)
summary(sigmaSE_prof)
```

Next, we'll skim off the top 20 likelihoods for each value of the $\sigma_{SE}$ parameter.
We'll put these through another round of miffing.

```{r sigmaSE-prof-round2,cache=FALSE}
sigmaSE_prof %>%
  mutate(sigmaSE=exp(signif(log(sigmaSE),5))) %>%
  ddply(~sigmaSE,subset,rank(-loglik)<=20) %>%

The preceding calculations took `r round(sum(sigmaSE_prof$etime),1)`&nbsp;cpu&nbsp;hr, or about `r signif(mean(sigmaSE_prof$etime)/550*3600,2)`&nbsp;cpu&nbsp;sec per iteration per 1000 particles.

```{r plot-sigmaSE-profile}
sigmaSE_prof %<>%
  subset(nfail.max==0) %>%
  mutate(sigmaSE=exp(signif(log(sigmaSE),5))) %>%
  ddply(~sigmaSE,subset,rank(-loglik)<=2)

sigmaSE_prof %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sigmaSE,y=loglik))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="loess")
```

Plot profile traces, which show the trade-off between intensity of extra-demographic stochasticity and duration of the infectious and latent periods.

```{r profile-traces}
pairs(~loglik+sigmaSE+R0+I(1/gamma)+I(1/sigma),
      data=sigmaSE_prof)
```

```{r include=FALSE,cache=FALSE,eval=TRUE,purl=TRUE}
closeCluster(cl)
try(detach("package:doMPI",unload=TRUE),silent=TRUE)
if (exists("mpi.exit")) mpi.exit()
try(detach("package:Rmpi",unload=TRUE),silent=TRUE)
```

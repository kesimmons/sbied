## Introduction: What is Simulation-based Inference?

## Overview of our ambitions

* __Goal__: To build understanding of disease transmission processes to improve public health.
    * Population-level processes: transmission events; susceptible, infected and recovered hosts. 
    * Within-host processes: pathogen vs the immune system; locations and life stages of pathogens.

<p>

* __Approach__: Using time series data to inform dynamic models.

<p>

* We may work with experimental or observational data:
    + For population-level epidemiological dynamics, data are usually observational.
    + For observational data, we must be cautious about inferring causality.
        * Association is not causation.
        * if $X$ appear to cause $Y$, could they both be determined by an unmeasured $Z$?
        * Known biological mechanisms can support the structure of mechanistic, causal models.

### Noisy clockwork: Time series analysis of population fluctuations in animals

#### Six problems of [Bjornstad and Grenfell (Science, 2001)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1062226)

* Obstacles for __ecological__ modeling and inference via nonlinear mechanistic models:

1. Combining measurement noise and process noise.

2. Including covariates in mechanistically plausible ways.

3. Continuous time models.

4. Modeling and estimating interactions in coupled systems. 

5. Dealing with unobserved variables.

6. Modeling spatial-temporal dynamics.

* The same issues arise for __epidemiological__ modeling and inference via nonlinear mechanistic models.


-------------------------------

### Partially observed Markov process (POMP) models


* Data $y^*_1,\dots,y^*_N$ collected at times $t_1<\dots<t_N$ are modeled as noisy and incomplete observations of a Markov process $\{X(t), t\ge t_0\}$.

* This is a __partially observed Markov process (POMP)__ model, also known as a hidden Markov model or a state space model.

* $\{X(t)\}$ is Markov if the history of the process, $\{X(s), s\le t\}$, is uninformative about the future of the process, $\{X(s), s\ge t\}$, given the current value of the process, $X(t)$. 

* If all quantities important for the dynamics of the system are placed in the __state__, $X(t)$, then the Markov property holds by construction.

* POMP models can include all the features desired by @Bjornstad2001.


------------------------------

#### Notation for partially observed Markov process models

* Write $X_n=X(t_n)$ and $X_{0:N}=(X_0,\dots,X_N)$. Let $Y_n$ be a random variable modeling the observation at time $t_n$.

* The one-step transition density, $f_{X_n|X_{n-1}}(x_n|x_{n-1};\theta)$, together with the measurement density, $f_{Y_n|X_n}(y_n|x_n;\theta)$ and the initial density, $f_{X_0}(x_0;\theta)$, specify the entire joint density via

$$f_{X_{0:N},Y_{1:N}}(x_{0:N},y_{1:N};\theta) = f_{X_0}(x_0;\theta)\,\prod_{n=1}^N\!f_{X_n | X_{n-1}}(x_n|x_{n-1};\theta)\,f_{Y_n|X_n}(y_n|x_n;\theta).$$

* The marginal density for sequence of measurements, $Y_{1:N}$, evaluated at the data, $y_{1:N}^*$, is

$$ f_{Y_{1:N}}(y^*_{1:N};\theta)=\int f_{X_{0:N},Y_{1:N}}(x_{0:N},y^*_{1:N};\theta)\, dx_{0:N}.
$$

------------------------------

To think algorithmically, we define some function calls:

* rprocess( ): a draw from $f_{X_n|X_{n-1}}(x_n| x_{n-1};\theta)$

* dprocess( ): evaluation of $f_{X_n|X_{n-1}}(x_n| x_{n-1};\theta)$

* rmeasure( ): a draw from $f_{Y_n|X_n}(y_n| x_n;\theta)$

* dmeasure( ): evaluation of $f_{Y_n|X_n}(y_n| x_n;\theta)$

------------------------------

### What does it mean for methodology to be __simulation-based__?

* Oftentimes, simulating random processes is easier than evaluating their transition probabilities.

* In other words, we may be able to write rprocess() but not dprocess().

*  __Simulation-based__ methods require the user to specify rprocess() but not dprocess().
 
* __Plug-and-play__, __likelihood-free__ and __equation-free__ are alternative terms for simulation-based.

* Much development of simulation-based statistical methodology has occurred in the past decade.

------------------------------

## Practicum: The **pomp**  **R**  package for POMP models

### Objectives

1. To introduce students to the **pomp** package
1. To explain how the components of a POMP model are encoded in this package
1. To give some experience in the use and manipulation of `pomp` objects

### Intro to **pomp**

* **pomp** is an  **R**  package for data analysis using partially observed Markov process (POMP) models.

* Note the distinction: lower case **pomp** is a software package; 
upper case POMP is a class of models.

* **pomp** builds methodology for POMP models in terms of arbitrary user-specified `rprocess()`, `dprocess()`, `rmeasure()`, and `dmeasure()` functions.
 
* Following modern practice, most methodology in **pomp** is simulation-based, so does not require specification of `dprocess()`.

* **pomp** has facilities to help construct `rprocess()`, `rmeasure()`, and `dmeasure()` functions for model classes of epidemiological interest.

* **pomp** provides a forum for development, modification and sharing of models, methodology and data analysis workflows.

The following diagrams show the structure of a POMP model schematically.

**The key perspective to keep in mind is that the model is to be viewed as the process that generated the data.**

The state process, $X_n$, is Markovian, i.e.,
$$\mathrm{Prob}[X_n|X_0,\dots,X_{n-1},Y_1,\dots,Y_{n-1}]=\mathrm{Prob}[X_n|X_{n-1}].$$
Moreover, the measurements, $Y_n$, depend only on the state at that time:
$$\mathrm{Prob}[Y_n|X_0,\dots,X_{n},Y_1,\dots,Y_{n-1}]=\mathrm{Prob}[Y_n|X_{n}],$$
for all $n=1,\dots,N$.

*********************

## Example: the Ricker model

[Download a script containing the **R** commands below.](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/kingaa/sbied/master/intro/intro.R)

#### The deterministic skeleton

The Ricker map describes the deterministic dynamics of a simple population:
$$N_{t+1} = r\,N_{t}\,\exp(-N_{t})$$

Here, $N_t$ is the population density at time $t$ and $r$ is a fixed value (a parameter), related to the population's intrinsic capacity to increase.
$N$ is a *state variable*, $r$ is a *parameter*.
If we know $r$ and the *initial condition* $N_0$, the deterministic Ricker equation predicts the future population density at all times $t=1,2,\dots$.
We can view the initial condition, $N_0$ as a special kind of parameter, an *initial-value parameter*.

#### Process noise

We can model process noise in this system by making the growth rate $r$ into a random variable.
For example, if we assume that the intrinsic growth rate is log-normally distributed, $N$ becomes a stochastic process governed by
$$N_{t+1} = r\,N_{t}\,\exp(-N_{t}+\varepsilon_{t}), \qquad \varepsilon_{t}\;\sim\;\dist{Normal}{0,\sigma},$$
where the new parameter $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the noise process $\varepsilon$.

#### Measurement error

Let's suppose that the Ricker model is our model for the dynamics of a real population.
However, we cannot know the exact population density at any time, but only estimate it through sampling.

Let's model measurement error by assuming the measurements, $y_t$, are Poisson with mean $\phi\,N_t$:
$$y_{t}\;\sim\;\dist{Poisson}{\phi\,N_{t}}$$

In this equation,

1. $N_t$ is the true population density at time $t$,
2. $y_t$ is the number of individuals sampled at time $t$,
3. the choice of units for $N$ is peculiar and depends on the parameters (e.g., $N=\log(r)$ is the equilibrium),
4. the parameter $\phi$ is proportional to our sampling effort, and also has peculiar units.

### Working with the Ricker model in **pomp**.

The  **R**  package **pomp** provides facilities for modeling POMPs, a toolbox of statistical inference methods for analyzing data using POMPs, and a development platform for implmenting new POMP inference methods.
The basic data-structure provided by **pomp** is the *object of class `pomp`*, alternatively known as a `pomp` object.
It is a container that holds real or simulated data and a POMP model, possibly together with other information such as model parameters, that may be needed to do things with the model and data.

Let's see what can be done with a `pomp` object.
First, if we haven't already, we must install **pomp** and `pompExamples`.
Run the following to do so.
```{r install-pomp,eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("kingaa/pomp")
# install_github("kingaa/pompExamples")
```

Now we'll load some packages, including **pomp**.
```{r prelims,cache=F}
set.seed(594709947L)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(reshape2)
library(pomp)
stopifnot(packageVersion("pomp")>="0.69-1")
```

A pre-built `pomp` object encoding the Ricker model comes included with the package.
Load it by
```{r load-ricker,cache=FALSE}
pompExample(ricker)
```
This has the effect of creating a `pomp` object named `ricker` in your workspace.
We can plot the data by doing
```{r plot-ricker}
plot(ricker)
```
We can simulate by doing
```{r sim-ricker1}
x <- simulate(ricker)
```
What kind of object have we created?
```{r}
class(x)
plot(x)
```
Why do we see more time series in the simulated `pomp` object?

We can turn a `pomp` object into a data frame:
```{r}
y <- as.data.frame(ricker)
head(y)
head(simulate(ricker,as.data.frame=TRUE))
```

We can also run multiple simulations simultaneously:
```{r}
x <- simulate(ricker,nsim=10)
class(x)
sapply(x,class)
x <- simulate(ricker,nsim=10,as.data.frame=TRUE)
head(x)
str(x)
```
Also,
```{r fig.height=8}
x <- simulate(ricker,nsim=9,as.data.frame=TRUE,include.data=TRUE)
ggplot(data=x,aes(x=time,y=y,group=sim,color=(sim=="data")))+
  geom_line()+guides(color=FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~sim,ncol=2)
```


We can compute a trajectory of the deterministic skeleton
```{r traj-ricker}
y <- trajectory(ricker)
dim(y)
dimnames(y)
plot(time(ricker),y["N",1,],type="l")
```

Notice that `ricker` has parameters associated with it:
```{r coef-ricker}
coef(ricker)
```
These are the parameters at which the simulations and deterministic trajectory computations above were done.
We can run these at different parameters:
```{r}
theta <- coef(ricker)
theta[c("r","N.0")] <- c(5,3)
y <- trajectory(ricker,params=theta)
plot(time(ricker),y["N",1,],type="l")
x <- simulate(ricker,params=theta)
plot(x,var="y")
```

We can also change the parameters stored inside of `ricker`:
```{r}
coef(ricker,c("r","N.0","sigma")) <- c(39,0.5,1)
coef(ricker)
plot(simulate(ricker),var="y")
```

In all of the above, it's possible to work with more than one set of parameters at a time.
For example:
```{r bifdiag}
p <- parmat(coef(ricker),500)
dim(p); dimnames(p)
p["r",] <- seq(from=2,to=40,length=500)
y <- trajectory(ricker,params=p,times=200:1000)
matplot(p["r",],y["N",,],pch=".",col='black',xlab='r',ylab='N',log='x')
```

More information on manipulating and extracting information from `pomp` objects can be viewed in the help pages (`methods?pomp`).

There are a number of other examples included with the package.
Do `pompExamples()` to see a list of these.

#### Inference algorithms in **pomp**

**pomp** provides a wide range of inference algorithms.
We'll learn about these in detail soon, but for now, let's just look at some of their general features.

The `pfilter` function runs a simple particle filter.
It can be used to evaluate the likelihood at a particular set of parameters.
One uses the `Np` argument to specify the number of particles to use:
```{r pfilter1}
pf <- pfilter(ricker,Np=1000)
class(pf)
plot(pf)
logLik(pf)
```

Note that `pfilter` returns an object of class `pfilterd.pomp`.
This is the general rule: inference algorithms return objects that are `pomp` objects with additional information.
The package provides tools to extract this information.
We can run the particle filter again by doing
```{r pfilter2}
pf <- pfilter(pf)
logLik(pf)
```
which has the result of running the same computation again.
Note that, because the particle filter is a Monte Carlo algorithm, we get a slightly different estimate of the log likelihood.

Note that, by default, running `pfilter` on a `pfilterd.pomp` object causes the computation to be re-run with the same parameters as before.
Any additional arguments we add override these defaults.
This is the general rule in **pomp**.
For example,
```{r pfilter3}
pf <- pfilter(pf,Np=100)
logLik(pf)
```
Here, the particle filtering has been performed with only `r unique(pf@Np)` particles.

## Building a custom `pomp` object

A real **pomp** data analysis begins with constructing one or more `pomp` objects to hold the data and the model or models under consideration.
We'll illustrate this process a dataset of *Parus major* abundance in Wytham Wood, near Oxford [@McCleery1991].

Download and plot the data:
```{r parus-data}
loc <- url("http://kingaa.github.io/sbied/data/parus.csv")
dat <- read.csv(loc)
head(dat)
plot(pop~year,data=dat,type='o')
```

Let's suppose that we want to fit the stochastic Ricker model discussed above to these data.

The call to construct a `pomp` object is, naturally enough, `pomp`.
Documentation on this function can be had by doing `?pomp`. 
Do `class?pomp` to get documentation on the `pomp` class.
Learn about the various things you can do once you have a `pomp` object by doing `methods?pomp` and following the links therein.
Read an overview of the package as a whole with links to its main features by doing `package?pomp`.
A complete index of the functions in **pomp** is returned by the command `library(help=pomp)`.
Finally, the home page for the `pomp` project is \url{http://kingaa.github.io/pomp};
there you have access to the complete source code, manuals, mailing lists, etc.

```{r parus-pomp1}
library(pomp)
parus <- pomp(dat,times="year",t0=1959)
```
The `times` argument specifies that the column labelled "year" gives the measurement times;
`t0` is the "zero-time", the time at which the state process will be initialized.
We've set it to one year prior to the beginning of the data.
Plot it:
```{r parus-plot1}
plot(parus)
```

#### Adding in the deterministic skeleton

We can add the Ricker model deterministic skeleton to the `parus` `pomp` object.
Since the Ricker model is a discrete-time model, its skeleton is a map that takes $N_t$ to $N_{t+1}$ according to the Ricker model equation
$$N_{t+1} = r\,N_{t}\,\exp(-N_{t}).$$
We provide this to `pomp` in the form of a `Csnippet`, a little snippet of C code that performs the computation.
```{r parus-skel-defn}
skel <- Csnippet("DN = r*N*exp(-N);")
```
We then add this to the `pomp` object:
```{r parus-add-skel}
parus <- pomp(parus,skeleton=skel,skeleton.type='map',
              paramnames=c("r"),statenames=c("N"))
```
Note that we have to inform **pomp** as to which of the variables we've referred to in `skel` is a state variable (`statenames`) and which is a parameter (`paramnames`).
The `skeleton.type` argument tells **pomp** that the skeleton is a discrete-time dynamical system (a map) rather than a continuous-time system (a vectorfield).

With just the skeleton defined, we are in a position to compute the trajectories of the deterministic skeleton at any point in parameter space.
For example,
```{r parus-first-traj,results='markup'}
traj <- trajectory(parus,params=c(N.0=1,r=12),as.data.frame=TRUE)
ggplot(data=traj,aes(x=time,y=N))+geom_line()
```

#### A note on terminology

If we know the state, $x(t_0)$, of the system at time $t_0$, it makes sense to speak about the entire trajectory of the system for all $t>t_0$.
This is true whether we are thinking of the system as deterministic or stochastic.
Of course, in the former case, the trajectory is uniquely determined by $x(t_0)$, while in the stochastic case, only the probability distribution of $x(t)$, $t>t_0$ is determined.
In **pomp**, to avoid confusion, we use the term "trajectory" exclusively to refer to *trajectories of a deterministic process*.
Thus, the `trajectory` command iterates or integrates the deterministic skeleton forward in time, returning the unique trajectory determined by the specified parameters.
When we want to speak about sample paths of a stochastic process, we use the term *simulation*.
Accordingly, the `simulate` command always returns individual sample paths from the POMP.
In particular, we avoid "simulating a set of differential equations", preferring instead to speak of "integrating" the equations, or "computing trajectories".

#### Adding in the process model simulator

We can add the stochastic Ricker model to `parus` by writing a Csnippet that simulates one realization of the stochastic process, from an arbitary time $t$ to $t+1$, given arbitrary states and parameters.
The following does this.
```{r parus-sim-defn}
stochStep <- Csnippet("
  e = rnorm(0,sigma);
  N = r*N*exp(-N+e);
")
pomp(parus,rprocess=discrete.time.sim(step.fun=stochStep,delta.t=1),
     paramnames=c("r","sigma"),statenames=c("N","e")) -> parus
```
Note that in the above, we use the `exp` and `rnorm` functions from the [**R** API](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-R-API).
In general any C function provided by **R** is available to you.
**pomp** also provides a number of C functions that are documented in the header file, `pomp.h`, that is installed with the package.
See the `Csnippet` documentation (`?Csnippet`) to read more about how to write them.
Note too that we use `discrete.time.sim` here because the model is a stochastic map.
We specify that the time step of the discrete-time process is `delta.t`, here, 1&nbsp;yr.

At this point, we have what we need to simulate the stochastic Ricker model.
```{r ricker-first-sim,results='markup'}
sim <- simulate(parus,params=c(N.0=1,e.0=0,r=12,sigma=0.5),
                as.data.frame=TRUE,states=TRUE)
plot(N~time,data=sim,type='o')
lines(N~time,data=traj,type='l',col='red')
```

#### Adding in the measurement model and parameters

We complete the specification of the POMP by specifying the measurement model.
To obtain the Poisson measurement model described above, we write two Csnippets.
The first simulates:
```{r parus-rmeas-defn}
rmeas <- Csnippet("pop = rpois(phi*N);")
```
and the second computes the likelihood of observing `pop` birds given a true density of `N`:
```{r parus-dmeas-defn}
dmeas <- Csnippet("lik = dpois(pop,phi*N,give_log);")
```
[Note the `give_log` argument.
When this code is evaluated, `give_log` will be set to 1 if the log likelihood is desired, and 0 else.]
We add these into the `pomp` object:
```{r parus-add-meas}
pomp(parus,rmeasure=rmeas,dmeasure=dmeas,statenames=c("N"),paramnames=c("phi")) -> parus
```
Now we can simulate the whole POMP.
First, let's add some parameters to the `pomp` object:
```{r ricker-add-params}
coef(parus) <- c(N.0=1,e.0=0,r=20,sigma=0.1,phi=200)
```
```{r ricker-second-sim,results='markup'}
sims <- simulate(parus,nsim=3,as.data.frame=TRUE,include.data=TRUE)
ggplot(data=sims,mapping=aes(x=time,y=pop))+geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~sim)
```

## Exercises

### Ricker model parameters
Fiddle with the parameters to try and make the simulations look more like the data.
This will help you build some intuition for what the various parameters do.

### Reformulating the Ricker model
Reparameterize the Ricker model so that the scaling of $N$ is explicit:
$$N_{t+1} = r\,N_{t}\,\exp\left(-\frac{N_{t}}{K}\right).$$

Modify the `pomp` object we created above to reflect this reparameterization.

Modify the measurement model so that
$$\mathrm{pop}_t \sim \dist{Negbin}{\phi\,N_t,k},$$
i.e., $\mathrm{pop}_t$ is negative-binomially distributed with mean $\phi\,N_t$ and clumping parameter $k$.
See `?NegBinomial` for documentation on the negative binomial distribution and [the **R** Extensions Manual section on distribution functions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Distribution-functions) for information on how to access these in C.

### Beverton-Holt
Construct a `pomp` object for the *Parus major* data and the stochastic Beverton-Holt model
$$N_{t+1} = \frac{a\,N_t}{1+b\,N_t}\,\varepsilon_t,$$
where $a$ and $b$ are parameters and
$$\varepsilon_t \sim \dist{Lognormal}{-\tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2,\sigma}.$$
Assume the same measurement model as before.
